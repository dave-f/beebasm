ORG &2000
\ On the first pass LOAD is called with an undefined symbol.
\ Test that the undefinedness propagates to the macro so
\ that the LDA has the correct width (i.e. not zero page).

\ This example fails because zp moves out of zero page between
\ passes.  It would be better if scopes couldn't override symbols
\ from outer scopes.
